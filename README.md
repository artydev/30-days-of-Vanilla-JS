# 30-days-of-Vanilla-JS
This repository has 30 mini project ideas (approx 2 hours each) that I will coding everyday. 

These ideas will not be much about beautification, than about the logic and learning how vanilla JS functions. 

VanillaJs means vanilla JS. I DO NOT use any framework.. not even Jquery, except some fonts like Roboto from google library. In every build I put maximum of 3 hours and whatever I can build. You can try at your end.

Here is the list of Ideas and their links and screenshots.
